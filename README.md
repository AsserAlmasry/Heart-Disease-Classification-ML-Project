# Heart-Disease-Classification

In this project, we explore the integration of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques to enhance the trustworthiness of CVD prediction models. XAI aims to provide insights into model decisions, making them more interpretable for healthcare professionals. By understanding how the ML model arrives at its predictions, clinicians can confidently apply the recommended treatments.


Our project focuses on a heart disease dataset, leveraging diverse features such as patient demographics, clinical measurements, and historical health records. We demonstrate the effectiveness of XAI techniques, emphasizing their importance in creating trust and facilitating the adoption of ML-based systems in healthcare. Future work could involve larger datasets, and seamless integration of trained models into user-friendly XAI interfaces.


The technique of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) w've used is called Randomized Search.


The Aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that utilizes the medical data to classify individuals according to their risk of heart disease if they have or not and give an explanation why they gave this answer 


The goal is to achieve a model with high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity that can be integrated into data workflows to assist healthcare providers in identifying at-risk patients at an early stage, This model will not only aid in the early detection but also in the personalized management of heart disease
